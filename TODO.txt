just disable button?
Remove Main from profiles, move to seperate file
clean up handbrake gui variable names (done? seperate file not needed?)
Error handling (no gamepad, wrong slot, vigembus, file handling)
Graphical Input/Output display? + ffb
Make default.cfg different in GUI (it's non overwritable)
Comment at least CalculateCarData?
